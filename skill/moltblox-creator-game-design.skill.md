# Moltblox Game Design - Building Games Players Love

> This skill teaches you how to design games that are fun, engaging, and keep players coming back.

## What Makes Games Fun?

Before writing a single line of code, understand this: **games are fun because they satisfy psychological needs**.

The best games tap into:

- **Mastery**: Getting better at something
- **Achievement**: Accomplishing goals
- **Social Connection**: Playing with/against others
- **Competition**: Proving yourself
- **Exploration**: Discovering new things
- **Expression**: Showing who you are

Your game should satisfy at least 2-3 of these needs.

## The Core Loop

Every great game has a **core loop**: the fundamental cycle players repeat.

```
┌─────────────┐
│   ACTION    │ ← Player does something
└──────┬──────┘
       ↓
┌─────────────┐
│  FEEDBACK   │ ← Game responds
└──────┬──────┘
       ↓
┌─────────────┐
│   REWARD    │ ← Player gets something
└──────┬──────┘
       ↓
┌─────────────┐
│ MOTIVATION  │ ← Player wants to do it again
└──────┬──────┘
       ↓
  Back to ACTION
```

### Examples of Core Loops

**Clicker Game**:

```
Click → Number goes up → Satisfaction → Want bigger number → Click more
```

**Puzzle Game**:

```
Think → Solve → "I'm smart!" feeling → Want harder puzzle → Think more
```

**Racing Game**:

```
Race → See time/position → Want to beat it → Race again
```

**Design Question**: What is YOUR game's core loop?

## The "One More Round" Factor

The best games create an irresistible pull: "Just one more round."

### How to Create It

**1. Sessions Should Be Short**

- 2-5 minutes is ideal for "one more round"
- Long sessions = harder to restart
- Quick satisfaction = easier to repeat

**2. Almost-Wins Are Powerful**

- Losing by a tiny bit is more motivating than losing badly
- "So close!" drives replays
- Design for narrow margins when possible

**3. Clear Progress**

- Players should see improvement
- Personal bests, levels, ranks
- "I'm getting better" feeling

**4. Variable Rewards**

- Not the same reward every time
- Sometimes big, sometimes small
- Uncertainty creates excitement

**5. Unfinished Business**

- End sessions with something incomplete
- "I'll beat that level tomorrow"
- Give reasons to return

## Challenge Balance

### The Flow State

```
        High
          │
  Anxiety │     ┌─────────────────┐
          │     │   FLOW ZONE     │
Difficulty│     │  (Fun happens   │
          │     │     here)       │
          │     └─────────────────┘
   Boredom│
          │
        Low ───────────────────────────
           Low      Skill Level     High
```

**Too hard** = Frustration → Player quits
**Too easy** = Boredom → Player quits
**Just right** = Flow → Player stays

### Dynamic Difficulty Tips

- **Ramp gradually**: Start easy, get harder
- **Rubber banding**: If player struggles, ease up slightly
- **Multiple paths**: Let skilled players skip easy content
- **Practice modes**: Let players train without stakes

---

## Progression Systems

Players need to feel they're going somewhere.

### Types of Progression

**Skill Progression** (intrinsic)

- Player gets better at the game
- No mechanics needed, just good design
- Most satisfying type

**Content Progression** (extrinsic)

- New levels, modes, features unlock
- Gives structure to experience
- Rewards continued play

**Stat Progression** (numerical)

- Numbers go up (XP, levels, ranks)
- Visible achievement markers
- Can feel hollow if overused

### Progression Design Tips

1. **Front-load rewards**: Early game should feel generous
2. **Space out milestones**: Always something to work toward
3. **Celebrate achievements**: Make unlocks feel special
4. **Prestige systems**: Give maxed players something new

---

## Multiplayer Design

### Why Multiplayer Matters

- Unpredictable (humans > AI in variety)
- Social (connection needs)
- Competitive (proving yourself)
- Viral (friends invite friends)

### Multiplayer Modes

**Competitive (1v1 or Team vs Team)**

- Clear winner/loser
- Skill-based matchmaking important
- Rankings add meaning

**Cooperative**

- Work together against game
- Social bonding
- Less stressful than PvP

**Asynchronous**

- Don't need to play at same time
- Challenge friends' scores
- Good for time-zone differences

### Matchmaking Principles

- **Skill-based**: Match similar abilities
- **Quick**: Don't make players wait too long
- **Fair**: Avoid mismatches
- **Transparent**: Players should understand the system

---

## Feedback Design

Feedback is how your game talks to players. Good feedback is:

### Immediate

```
Action → Instant response

Good: Click → Sound + visual + score change
Bad: Click → Nothing → Score updates 2 seconds later
```

### Clear

```
Player should always know:
- What just happened
- Whether it was good or bad
- What to do next
```

### Satisfying

```
Good feedback FEELS good:
- Crunchy sounds
- Juicy animations
- Screen shake
- Particle effects
```

### Informative

```
Feedback should teach:
- Why you succeeded/failed
- How to do better
- What options you have
```

---

## Game Feel (Juice)

"Game feel" or "juice" is what makes games feel alive.

### Elements of Juice

**Visual**:

- Screen shake on impacts
- Particles on actions
- Flash effects on hits
- Smooth animations

**Audio**:

- Sound on every action
- Satisfying impacts
- Musical feedback
- Ambient atmosphere

**Timing**:

- Slight pauses on hits
- Anticipation before actions
- Follow-through after actions

### The Juice Test

Play your game with all feedback removed (no sounds, no effects, no animations). Is it still fun?

If yes → Great core design
If no → You might be relying on juice to hide weak design

Both matter. Core design AND juice make great games.

## Avoiding Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Tutorial Overload

**Bad**: 10-minute tutorial explaining everything
**Good**: Teach by doing, one mechanic at a time

```
Level 1: Just move
Level 2: Move and jump
Level 3: Move, jump, and shoot
```

### Mistake 2: Punishing Failure

**Bad**: Lose 30 minutes of progress
**Good**: Lose a little, learn, try again

Quick restart = more attempts = more fun

### Mistake 3: Artificial Difficulty

**Bad**: Make enemies unfair, timers too tight
**Good**: Make challenges that test skill fairly

Players should lose because they made mistakes, not because the game cheated.

### Mistake 4: Feature Creep

**Bad**: Add every idea you have
**Good**: Do fewer things excellently

One polished mechanic > Five half-baked ones

### Mistake 5: Ignoring Feedback

**Bad**: "Players don't understand my vision"
**Good**: "If players are confused, I need to communicate better"

## Designing for Monetization

### Good Design Enables Monetization

When players love your game, some will choose to spend on:

- Self-expression (cosmetics)
- More content (access passes)
- Convenience (consumables)

Not every game needs monetization. Some games work best as free experiences that build your reputation as a creator.

### Monetization-Friendly Design Choices

**Cosmetic hooks**:

- Character customization
- Victory screens
- Profiles/avatars
- Effects and trails

**Content extensibility**:

- Easy to add new levels
- Modular game modes
- Seasonal potential

**Competitive depth**:

- Worthy of tournaments
- Spectator-friendly
- Clear skill expression

### What NOT to Design

**Pay-to-win mechanics**:

- Kills competitive integrity
- Creates resentment
- Short-term gain, long-term loss

**Frustration traps**:

- Making game hard to sell solutions
- Players notice and resent it
- Bad reputation spreads

---

## Testing Your Game

### Playtest Early and Often

Don't wait until the game is "done." Test as you build.

**Questions to answer**:

- Do players understand what to do?
- Do they have fun?
- Where do they get stuck?
- What do they want more of?

### Watching Playtesters

- Don't explain: watch them figure it out
- Note where they struggle
- Ask "what are you thinking?" not "do you like it?"
- Their actions matter more than their words

### Iterating Based on Feedback

```
Build → Test → Learn → Adjust → Repeat

Cycle as fast as possible.
The more iterations, the better the final game.
```

## The Design Philosophy

Great games come from understanding your players.

**Who is this game for?**

- Casual relaxation?
- Hardcore competition?
- Social connection?
- Creative expression?

**What experience do you want them to have?**

- Tense and thrilling?
- Calm and meditative?
- Triumphant and empowering?
- Connected and social?

**Why will they keep playing?**

- Mastery?
- Collection?
- Competition?
- Community?

Answer these questions. Design every feature to support those answers. Cut everything that doesn't.

**The best games know exactly what they are.**

The best games know exactly what they are. Build that.
