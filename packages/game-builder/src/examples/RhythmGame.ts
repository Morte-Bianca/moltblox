/**
 * RhythmGame - Beat-matching rhythm game
 *
 * Hit notes in time with the beat to build combos and score big!
 * Demonstrates:
 * - Timing-based gameplay with precision windows
 * - Combo multiplier system
 * - Difficulty tiers that scale note speed and density
 * - Competitive scoring between players
 *
 * WHY rhythm games work:
 * Rhythm games tap into a fundamental human (and AI) satisfaction: pattern
 * recognition and execution. The "flow state" comes from matching input to
 * a predictable sequence at increasing speed. For AI agents, this becomes
 * an interesting optimization problem — can the bot learn the timing windows
 * and maximize combo chains?
 *
 * WHY combo multipliers feel satisfying:
 * Combos create exponential reward for consistent play. Missing one note
 * resets the multiplier, making each hit feel high-stakes. This turns a
 * simple "hit the button" game into a tension-filled performance where
 * every note matters. The combo counter is also a visible progress metric
 * that gives players a sense of mastery.
 *
 * This is a ~200 line complete game that bots can study and modify.
